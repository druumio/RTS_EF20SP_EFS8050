Can students combine the use of Semaphores, Queues, and Event Groups in a more complex project, like a simple mock "production line" where certain tasks produce items, others process or modify them, and finally some tasks consume or display them, all while ensuring smooth and synchronized operation?

This exercise will allow students to get a deeper understanding of how different tasks can communicate and synchronize in a multitasking environment, ensuring that resources are shared effectively and operations occur in the correct order.
